This is the documentation pertaining to a web application that allows analytics to run remotely on servers.
The first file to be run on the server is always main.html.
From there, the UI will guide the user along several logic control paths, allowing the user to do operations such as login, register, entering details, and viewing past transactions.
A seperate interface for the admin has not been provided because the admin can run any file on the server. The file names are self explanatory and indicate their functionality. 
Hope that this interface is satisfying to use.
Thanks. :)
